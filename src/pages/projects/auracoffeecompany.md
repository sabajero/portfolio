# Aura Coffee Company

EN

Aura Maria Cobo epitaph reads a text I wrote some days after she died:

Your corporal light left to illuminate our hearts, infinite thanks, your dreams are also my dreams and someday I will open again the door to that world that today closed, see you soon.

## Introduction

The following essay is an exploration and reflection on the life of my great aunt Aura, who worked in the Merino coffee factory in the 60s. Starting from her oral tradition and stories around coffee, I carry out an essay that crosses approaches from sound philosophy to talk about silencing, the defiance of family narratives, and sound in my artistic practice as another way of making memory. 

The process to get to Aura, to approach what her teachings left me and later to make this essay, was a bit like touching a wound, lifting a weight again and suddenly feeling the inflammation between the vertebrae of a dormant hernia. It has been almost two years since she died and during this time I have wondered a lot about her legacy, especially because accompanying her in her last days in bed, I thought about how little physical space she occupied, everything fit in a small closet of no more than two meters and even she became as small as a tuber or an old ginger. As I grew up with her, with her omnipresent presence in my enclosed world as a child, her existence was vital to me, for she was the one who, together with my parents, was always in my imaginary home, and her words, stories, jokes, sayings, were a door to a world I was fascinated by, a door to my family two generations back, to their stories of love, war, illness and death, which reflected the history of the land where I was born, and which surely ignited my desire to search for images.

Speaking from the self-referential, digging into my family stories to talk about my context is something that has persisted in my artistic practice since undergrad, and eventually in my first semester of masters, hoping to further explore topics such as memory and family oral traditions, I enrolled in Prof. Petra Klusmeyer's Sound Theories Aloud class. I didn't read the class description carefully but my intention was to develop my knowledge of sound to confidently include it in my artistic practice, a few years ago I had worked making soundscape and played sounds in various software programs, as well as recorded some music sessions with friends, and I remember reading a couple of things related to film and immersive sound creation. 

But beyond that I knew nothing, so I started the semester and from the beginning I learned about theories about sound, sound practices, about thinking sonically and how to research from sound, Petra's guidance was always very intelligent and holistic, with many references, podcasts, poems, sounds and contributions that inspired me a lot in my writing and in my final essay. In the following, then, I give a very personal account of my experience in the course and the construction of my essay.

## A little bit about the way I work

One of the methodologies that most interested me in the class was the talks and discussions about the readings and the creative writing spaces after each class, we all shared questions that the texts raised and then we tried to answer together, we listened or continued discussing and then we wrote with all the information fresh in our brains, like a verbiage. First, inspired by the work Ghana Airlines by Hakeem Adams, I wondered about my identity, I thought about how I could talk about the importance of my aunt's stories in the construction of my identity, how to approach the subject and what threads to pull to create a narrative from sound. I felt that I had had similar interests in projects such as El Toro más fuerte, where I question and contrast the family narrative of a disappeared uncle with his archive and the historical events of Colombia in the 80's, and as he was a student of Petra, in class I received a lot of information about his approaches to a research question. 

> “One particular point that now I remember in relation to this class material is about the archive of my family, I would say even the “sonic tradition” of my family, fictions my family created to explain his death and give closure (...) these fictions have the power of unveiling strong connections that could overcome the linearity of time, creating interesting perspectives to hear.”

Fragment of my writing session from November 12, 2024.

From these exercises was born the idea of talking about my great aunt Aura, mainly after reading the text Silence by Ana Maria Gautier, because she writes about how silence has been used in many ways in history, including as a tool for political silencing or systematic silencing, in the case of my family, structures that silenced the voices of women, workers, opponents. An idea that resonated with me, because Aura in her life kept silent in many moments and had to do it for survival, for the maternal condition that was imposed on her when she became an orphan infant, for her work picking and choosing coffee in the rattle of machinery, for her invisible work raising rich children in the economic boom of Venezuela, and so throughout her life she dedicated herself to her imposed destiny, and in the end there is me who accompanied her in her last years and who I feel that I listened to her and loved her stories, fictions, expressions and joys. 

As a result of these feelings that I found two years after her death, I decided with her story and the sonorous inputs of the class, to ask myself about memory through the invisible, like the coffee bean, about what her labors were. What does a coffee bean sound like? What can it talk about? How through these questions, the family oral tradition and sound fiction we can reconstruct and imagine a point in Aura's life, how it connects with the world in which she lived and also with the body that I embody.
