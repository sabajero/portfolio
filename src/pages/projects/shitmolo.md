## Introduction

In 2023 I joined Amazon as a Bilingual Customer Service Associate, a job I could do from my home in Cali, Colombia and to which I went because of the precariousness and the very few job offers at that time for Visual Arts and Design, here I would start my experience working in this giant corporation in a team in charge of preventing people from getting refunds, I was a “specialist” associate and even a supervisor, and during the year I worked there I realized first hand the digital and physical working conditions within Amazon, its robust information, data, surveillance, logistics and outsourcing systems as well as its powerful infrastructure that allow it to maintain and reproduce itself today as the second largest company in the world by revenue and as a symbol of global capitalism and the triumph of corporations over the quest for a sustainable world. Now almost 1 year after having quit to pursue my MA in Digital Media at HfK Bremen funded by a DAAD scholarship, I proposed to think about how we can characterize and reflect on Amazon's outsourcing infrastructures? how we can challenge them through fiction and speculation, in the form of kits or user manuals or games, even in radical ways. 

In our contemporary capitalism, outsourcing has become a recurrent if not mandatory practice to ensure profit margins, reduce costs and maximize efficiency (2016, Srnicek, N., & Williams, A.) and capital accumulation. This process generally involves the movement and deployment of certain parts of their corporate infrastructure of companies such as Amazon from their largest market (US or Canada for example in the case of retail) to regions and countries where labor is cheaper and potentially more exploitable (2016, Srnicek, N., & Williams, A.) as well as bounded and enclosed by borders or the sea (2019, McKenzie, W.). Through these infrastructures we can glimpse global power relations, the centralization of power and accumulation of wealth. Amazon uses this complex system of warehouse plants, logistics management and supply chains, as well as its systems of surveillance and learning in virtual workers, to train, maintain and scale its centralized control. Understanding these infrastructures is crucial because they shape working conditions, corporate power over the regulations of outsourced countries and the ability of workers to resist. By analyzing Amazon's model, cross-referencing it with my inside experience in customer service and logistics we can map and critique how outsourcing infrastructures work and how to challenge them.

This essay also examines how fiction and speculative design can serve as tools of resistance. In Professor Ralf Baecker's Radical Machines class, I proposed, as a semester project, the creation of fictional kits or user manuals for customer service associates. The idea was to develop a kind of anarchist guide for workers like me, rethinking corporate logics through comics and a retro aesthetic inspired by 2000s video games. I was very inspired by speculative design approaches and I'm building this kit as a way to question the apparent singularity of capitalism; that this is the end, there are no more possible systems and corporations won, is there something beyond this, beyond work, beyond generating income? With these concerns at heart I try to offer alternative imaginaries to this catastrophic vision, combining my personal experience, my artistic practice and my research on infrastructures and post-capitalism. Thus, this somewhat verbose essay is an excuse to reflect on contemporary labor, inviting us to look with a critical but also playful lens at how to attack the paranoid lethargy that companies like Amazon impose on their workers.
