I was invited to conceptualize, design and illustrate this comic working hand to hand with the main researchers and women from the community, the comic tells the story of a vulnerable black woman in Buenaventura who is soon to give birth but is treated violently by the hospital just because the established stereotypes about black people, this of course based on experiences from the women. The comic was used as part of the socialization strategy to fight obstetric violence in Buenaventura and other towns in 2022.

## Implementation

The comic was part of the pedagogical material to be used in OEM workshops, as well as for women to take home and have them readily available. It was considered that they could be easily photocopied, so the collective project decided to use few tones. During the implementation and socialization process of the project, there were also interpretations of the comic's title, "Que no le pasa comadre," which roughly translates to "Don't let this happen to you Friend (feminine)". Additionally, a small song was composed based on the comic.
