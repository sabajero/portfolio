I am a young visual artist that lives and works in Bremen, Germany. I've focused my work towards topics such as the relationships between body and city, family archives, disappearance  and illness, expressing these ideas through traditional techniques like painting, drawing and performance as well as digital and other medium techniques like animation, soundscape, and research-creation. The body in dispute, as a political and poetic issue, is the central axis of my work. Due to the nature of my bachelor degree, I also have a strong background in pedagogy, aesthetics and art history.


As a graphic designer, I have specialized in illustration, visual thinking, and product design, working closely with various companies, universities, and regional institutions in interdisciplinary teams and projects. These projects encompass topics such as university continuing education, non-profit training programs with vulnerable communities, and government projects for women's equality and welfare.


In my free time, as a personal note, I am an amateur musician. I studied three years of music in high school with an emphasis on piano, and I greatly enjoy trail running.
